# Chapter 04: Currying

## Can't Live If Livin' Is without You
My Dad once explained how there are certain things one can live without until one acquires them. A microwave is one such thing. Smart phones, another. The older folks among us will remember a fulfilling life sans internet. For me, currying is on this list.

The concept is simple: You can call a function with fewer arguments than it expects. It returns a function that takes the remaining arguments.

You can choose to call it all at once or simply feed in each argument piecemeal.

```python
add = lambda x: lambda y: x+y
increment = add(1)
add_ten = add(10)

increment(2) #3
add_ten(2) #12
```

Here we've made a function `add` that takes one argument and returns a function. By calling it, the returned function remembers the first argument from then on via the closure. Calling it with both arguments all at once is a bit of a pain, however, so we can use a special helper function called `curry` to make defining and calling functions like this easier.

Let's set up a few curried functions for our enjoyment. From now on, we'll summon our `curry`
function defined in the [Appendix A - Essential Function Support](./appendix_a.md). 


```python
match = curry(lambda what, s: re.findall(what,s))
replace = curry(lambda what, replacement, s: re.sub(what, replacement, s))
filter = curry()
map = curry(lambda f, xs: [f(x) for x in xs])
```

The pattern I've followed is a simple, but important one. I've strategically positioned the data we're operating on (str, list) as the last argument. It will become clear as to why upon use.


```python
match('r', 'hello world'); # ['r']

has_letter_r = match('r') # lambda s: re.findall('r',s)
has_letter_r('hello world') # ['r']
has_letter_r('just j and s and t etc') # []

filter(has_letter_r, ['rock and roll', 'smooth jazz']) # ['rock and roll']

remove_strings_without_rs = filter(has_letter_rs) # lambda xs: [x for x in xs if re.findall("r",x)] 
remove_strings_without_rs(['rock and roll', 'smooth jazz', 'drum circle']) # ['rock and roll', 'drum circle']

no_vowels = replace(r'[aeiou]') # lambda r,x:  re.sub(r'[aeiou]', r, x)
censored = no_vowels('*') # lambda x:  re.sub(r'[aeiou]', '*', x)
censored('Chocolate Rain'); # 'Ch*c*l*t* R**n'
```

What's demonstrated here is the ability to "pre-load" a function with an argument or two in order to receive a new function that remembers those arguments.

I encourage you to clone the Mostly Adequate repository (`git clone
https://github.com/tartavull/mostly-adequate-guide.git`), copy the code above and have a
go at it in the REPL. The curry function, as well as actually anything is defined in the appendixes.


## More Than a Pun / Special Sauce

Currying is useful for many things. We can make new functions just by giving our base functions some arguments as seen in `has_letter_r`, `remove_strings_without_rs`, and `censored`.

We also have the ability to transform any function that works on single elements into a function that works on arrays simply by wrapping it with `map`:

```python
get_children = lambda x: x['children']
all_the_children = map(get_children)
```

We can also use `functools.partial`, which is more verbose than just currying:
```python
from functools import partial
all_the_children = partial(map, get_children)
```

Giving a function fewer arguments than it expects is typically called *partial application*. Partially applying a function can remove a lot of boiler plate code. Consider what the above `all_the_children` function would be with the uncurried `map`:

```python
all_the_children = lambda elements: map(elements, get_children)
```

We typically don't define functions that work on arrays, because we can just call `map(get_children)` inline. Same with `sort`, `filter`, and other higher order functions (a *higher order function* is a function that takes or returns a function).

When we spoke about *pure functions*, we said they take 1 input to 1 output. Currying does exactly this: each single argument returns a new function expecting the remaining arguments. That, old sport, is 1 input to 1 output.

No matter if the output is another function - it qualifies as pure. We do allow more than one argument at a time, but this is seen as merely removing the extra `()`'s for convenience.



## In Summary

Currying is handy and I very much enjoy working with curried functions on a daily basis. It is a tool for the belt that makes functional programming less verbose and tedious.

We can make new, useful functions on the fly simply by passing in a few arguments and as a bonus, we've retained the mathematical function definition despite multiple arguments.

Let's acquire another essential tool called `compose`.
